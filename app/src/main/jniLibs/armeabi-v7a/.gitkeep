# NDI Library Directory (armeabi-v7a)

Place libndi.so for 32-bit ARM here (optional).

Download the NDI SDK from: https://ndi.video/
Extract and copy the Android armeabi-v7a libndi.so to this directory.

Note: This is optional. Most modern devices use arm64-v8a.
To enable 32-bit support, also add "armeabi-v7a" to abiFilters in build.gradle.kts
